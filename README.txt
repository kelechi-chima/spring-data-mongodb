This is a Java web app I created while learning Spring Data with MongoDB.

It is a multi-module project generated using Maven. The top-level/parent module is project-management, 
and its child modules are
 - project-management-model
 - project-management-repository
 - project-management-service
 - project-management-web.

The backend is MongoDB version 2.2.2.
The Spring version used is 3.2.1.RELEASE.
It was built using Maven version 3.0.4.
